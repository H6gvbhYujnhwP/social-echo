# Social Echo: Complete Signup Flow Implementation

**Author:** Manus AI
**Date:** October 04, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed summary of the new, complete signup flow implemented for the Social Echo application. This new flow streamlines the user journey from plan selection to payment and onboarding, providing a clear and intuitive experience for all new customers. The implementation is complete, tested, and has been pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub.

## 2. The New Signup Flow

The new signup flow is as follows:

1.  **"Get Started" to Pricing Page:** All "Get Started" buttons on the homepage and in the main navigation now direct users to a comprehensive pricing page.

2.  **Plan Selection:** On the pricing page, users can review all available plans (Starter, Pro, and Agency tiers) and select the one that best fits their needs.

3.  **Signup with Pre-selected Plan:** Upon selecting a plan, the user is taken to the signup page with their chosen plan pre-selected and clearly displayed.

4.  **Stripe Checkout:** After completing the signup form, the user is automatically redirected to a Stripe checkout session to securely enter their payment information.

5.  **Plan-Based Redirect After Payment:** After a successful payment, the user is redirected to the appropriate starting page based on their selected plan:
    *   **Starter and Pro Plans:** Users are redirected to the training page (`/train`) to begin setting up their AI.
    *   **Agency Plans:** Users are redirected to a new, dedicated agency dashboard (`/agency`) to manage their clients and white-label settings.

## 3. Implementation Details

### 3.1. Homepage and Navigation

*   The main "Get Started" button in the header (`components/Header.tsx`) now links to `/pricing` instead of `/signup`.
*   All plan selection buttons on the homepage (`app/page.tsx`) now also link to the `/pricing` page, ensuring a consistent entry point into the new flow.

### 3.2. Enhanced Pricing Page

*   The pricing page (`app/pricing/page.tsx`) has been updated to handle plan selection. The previous `CheckoutButton` components have been replaced with standard buttons that trigger a redirect to the signup page.
*   The selected plan's key (e.g., `SocialEcho_Pro`) is passed as a URL parameter to the signup page (e.g., `/signup?plan=SocialEcho_Pro`).

### 3.3. Signup Page

*   The signup page (`app/signup/page.tsx`) was already equipped to handle the `plan` URL parameter. It now displays the selected plan to the user, confirming their choice before they create their account.
*   After a successful signup, the page initiates the Stripe checkout process for the selected plan.

### 3.4. Post-Payment Redirect Logic

*   The checkout API endpoint (`app/api/checkout/route.ts`) has been updated to include dynamic redirect logic.
*   It checks if the selected `planKey` contains the word "Agency".
*   If it is an agency plan, the `success_url` for the Stripe checkout session is set to the new agency dashboard (`/agency?welcome=1`).
*   For all other plans (Starter and Pro), the `success_url` is set to the training page (`/train?welcome=1`).

### 3.5. New Agency Dashboard

*   A new agency dashboard page has been created at `app/agency/page.tsx`.
*   This page serves as the dedicated home for agency users and will be the central hub for managing clients, branding, and other agency-specific features.
*   It currently includes a welcome message and a placeholder for upcoming agency features.

## 4. Deployment

All changes related to the new signup flow have been successfully built, committed, and pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub. The application is now ready for deployment with the new, streamlined user journey fully integrated.
