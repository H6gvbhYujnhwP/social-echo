### 🚧 10. Learning from User Customizations

**Requirement**: Track what users change in the "Customise Today's Output" modal to understand their preferences and improve future generations.

**Implementation**:

1. **Track Customizations**:
   - Save every customization to `Customization` table
   - Fields: original post type, custom post type, original tone, custom tone, twist, keywords
   - Associate with user and timestamp

2. **Analyze Patterns**:
   - Identify user's preferred post type (if they always override Auto)
   - Identify preferred tone (if they always change from Professional to Casual)
   - Extract common keywords from twists
   - Detect patterns in customization frequency

3. **Apply Learning**:
   - After 5+ customizations, analyze patterns
   - If user consistently changes post type: Update their planner defaults
   - If user consistently changes tone: Update their profile tone
   - If user adds similar keywords repeatedly: Add to their profile keywords
   - Show suggestion: "We noticed you prefer [X]. Would you like to update your defaults?"

4. **Smart Defaults**:
   - Pre-fill customization modal with learned preferences
   - Adjust AI prompts based on customization history
   - Personalize content generation over time

**Benefits**:
