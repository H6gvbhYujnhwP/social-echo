## Analysis:
**PROBLEM CONFIRMED**: This is EXACTLY the issue Rob reported. The post is about:
- AI adoption by UK SMEs
- AI tools and digital transformation
- Generic tech/AI content

**What Rob NEEDS** (Financial Services/Leasing):
- FCA regulations
- Lending rules
- Asset finance news
- Leasing industry updates
- SME funding regulations

**Root Cause**: The news service is pulling generic "UK SMEs" stories about AI adoption instead of industry-specific financial services content.

**Severity**: CRITICAL - This is completely irrelevant to Rob's business and industry.
