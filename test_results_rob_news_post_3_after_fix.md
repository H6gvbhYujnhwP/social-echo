## Analysis:
**CRITICAL: FIX NOT WORKING YET**

This is the THIRD consecutive AI adoption post - identical topic to posts #1 and #2.

**Possible Reasons:**
1. Render deployment still in progress (code not deployed yet)
2. Server-side caching of news results
3. Code deployed but not restarted properly
4. Build failed on Render

**Evidence Fix Not Deployed:**
- Same AI adoption content
- Same "40% of SMEs" statistic
- Same irrelevant topic for Financial Services

**Next Steps:**
1. Check Render deployment logs
2. Verify build completed successfully
3. May need to manually restart service
4. Check server logs for query results
5. Generate more test posts after confirming deployment
