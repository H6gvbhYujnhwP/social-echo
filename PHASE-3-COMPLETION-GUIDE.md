**Last Updated:** October 6, 2025  
**Status:** Phase 3 Complete

---

## ðŸš€ Overview

This document summarizes the completion of Phase 3 of the Social Echo agency platform implementation. This phase focused on critical billing and user experience enhancements, including updating the agency pricing model, refreshing the public-facing pricing page, enhancing Stripe webhook logging for better diagnostics, and integrating a dedicated billing tab into the agency dashboard.

All changes have been successfully implemented, tested, and are ready for deployment.

## âœ… Key Changes in Phase 3

### 1. Agency Pricing Update to Â£39/Client/Month

The core change in this phase was updating the agency billing model from a fixed Â£49/client/month to a more competitive **Â£39/client/month**. This change is reflected in all relevant parts of the application, including the agency dashboard and the public pricing page.

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/ubuntu/social-echo/app/agency/page.tsx`
- `/home/ubuntu/social-echo/app/pricing/page.tsx`

### 2. Comprehensive Pricing Page Refresh

The public pricing page (`/pricing`) has been completely overhauled to reflect the new, simplified "Grow as You Go" agency model. The previous three-tiered system (Starter, Growth, Scale) has been replaced with a single, unified offering at Â£39/client/month, with features from all three previous tiers now available to all agency clients.

**Key Changes:**
- **Unified Pricing:** All agency plans now clearly display the **Â£39/client/month** rate.
- **Simplified Messaging:** The confusing three-tier system has been removed, replaced with a clear "Grow as You Go" message.
- **Feature Consolidation:** Features previously exclusive to higher tiers (e.g., custom domains, priority support) are now highlighted as part of the single agency offering.

### 3. Enhanced Stripe Webhook Logging

To improve diagnostics and monitoring of the billing system, the Stripe webhook handler has been enhanced with comprehensive logging for all critical events. This will allow for easier debugging of payment issues, subscription changes, and other billing-related events.

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/ubuntu/social-echo/app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

**Enhanced Logging Includes:**
- **Event Reception:** Logs every incoming webhook event with its type and ID.
- **Checkout Completion:** Detailed logging for `checkout.session.completed`, including customer email and user ID.
- **Subscription Updates:** Logs for `customer.subscription.updated` and `customer.subscription.created`, including plan changes and quantities.
- **Cancellations & Failures:** Detailed logs for `customer.subscription.deleted` and `invoice.payment_failed` events.
- **Email Notifications:** Logs when payment success, failure, upgrade, and cancellation emails are sent.

### 4. Billing Tab Integration in Agency Dashboard

A dedicated "Billing & Subscription" tab has been integrated into the agency dashboard, providing agency administrators with a clear and centralized view of their billing information.

**Files Modified:**
- `/home/ubuntu/social-echo/app/agency/page.tsx`
- `/home/ubuntu/social-echo/components/AgencyBillingTab.tsx`

**Features of the New Billing Tab:**
- **Tab Navigation:** A clear and intuitive tabbed interface to switch between "Client Management" and "Billing & Subscription".
- **Real-time Billing Info:** The billing tab displays up-to-date information, including the current plan, number of active clients, and the calculated next bill amount based on the Â£39/client rate.
- **Billing Portal Access:** A prominent "Manage Billing & Payment Methods" button that directs the user to the Stripe customer portal.

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Verification

All changes in this phase have been thoroughly tested to ensure they function correctly and do not introduce any regressions.

**Testing Steps Performed:**
1.  **TypeScript Compilation:** All modified files were checked for TypeScript errors using `npx tsc --noEmit --skipLibCheck`. No errors were found.
2.  **Next.js Build:** The application was successfully built using `npm run build` to ensure all pages and components compile correctly.
3.  **Manual Verification:**
    *   The agency dashboard correctly displays the new Â£39/client/month pricing.
    *   The pricing page accurately reflects the updated agency plan.
    *   The billing tab in the agency dashboard is fully functional and displays correct information.

## ðŸš€ Deployment Guide

No new environment variables or database migrations are required for this deployment. The changes are primarily in the frontend and API logic.

**Deployment Steps:**
1.  Merge the latest changes from the development branch into the main/production branch.
2.  Deploy the application to your hosting provider (e.g., Vercel, Render).
3.  After deployment, perform a final verification of the agency dashboard and pricing page to ensure the new pricing and UI changes are live.

This concludes the summary of the Phase 3 implementation. The Social Echo agency platform is now one step closer to a full-featured, robust, and user-friendly solution for agency clients.
