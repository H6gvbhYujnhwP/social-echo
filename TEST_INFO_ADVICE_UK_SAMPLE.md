## Post Text

Most people think using technical terms impresses clients. It doesn't.

In IT, clarity beats complexity every time.

Here's a tip: Swap jargon for simple language.

Instead of "cloud-based solutions," say "online storage."

Why does this matter?

Because clear communication builds trust and closes deals faster.

üéØ Target: Simplify 3 phrases in your next pitch. Watch engagement rise.
