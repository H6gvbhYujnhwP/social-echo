**Author:** Manus AI
**Date:** October 04, 2025

## 1. Overview

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the newly implemented and enhanced user management features for the Social Echo admin interface. All features are now fully functional, and the associated build errors have been resolved. The code has been successfully pushed to the main branch on GitHub, and the application is ready for deployment.

## 2. Implemented Features

The following user management features have been implemented and are accessible from the user details modal in the admin dashboard:

### 2.1. Hard User Deletion

*   **Description:** This feature allows an administrator to permanently delete a user account and all associated data from the database. This is a "hard delete" operation and is irreversible.
*   **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/admin/users/[id]/delete`
*   **Frontend Implementation:** A "Delete User" button in the user detail modal triggers a confirmation dialog. Upon confirmation, the `deleteUser` function is called, sending a request to the API with `{ mode: 'hard' }` in the request body.

### 2.2. Reset Password

*   **Description:** This feature allows an administrator to generate a password reset link for a user. The link is then copied to the administrator's clipboard.
*   **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/admin/users/[id]/reset-password`
*   **Frontend Implementation:** A "Reset Password" button in the user detail modal calls the `resetPassword` function. The API returns a reset URL, which is then copied to the clipboard using `navigator.clipboard.writeText()`.

### 2.3. Change Email

*   **Description:** This feature allows an administrator to change a user's email address. The new email address is validated to ensure it is a valid format and is not already in use by another user.
*   **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/admin/users/[id]/email`
*   **Frontend Implementation:** A "Change Email" button in the user detail modal prompts the administrator to enter the new email address. The `changeEmail` function then sends the new email to the API.

### 2.4. View Posts

*   **Description:** This feature allows an administrator to view a user's 50 most recent posts.
*   **API Endpoint:** `GET /api/admin/users/[id]/posts`
*   **Frontend Implementation:** A "View Posts" button in the user detail modal calls the `viewPosts` function. The API returns a list of the user's posts, which are then displayed in an alert dialog.

### 2.5. Reset Usage

*   **Description:** This feature allows an administrator to reset a user's monthly usage count to zero.
*   **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/admin/users/[id]/reset-usage`
*   **Frontend Implementation:** A "Reset Usage Count" button in the user detail modal calls the `resetUsage` function after a confirmation prompt.

### 2.6. Edit Notes

*   **Description:** This feature allows an administrator to add or edit administrative notes for a user.
*   **API Endpoint:** `POST /api/admin/users/[id]/notes`
*   **Frontend Implementation:** An "Edit Notes" button in the user detail modal prompts the administrator to enter or edit the notes. The `updateNotes` function then sends the notes to the API.

## 3. Bug Fixes

Several build errors were identified and fixed during the implementation process:

*   **TypeScript Type Errors:** The `UserRow` type in `app/admin/users/page.tsx` was missing the `notes` field. This was added to the type definition.
*   **Prisma Field Name Mismatch:** The `reset-password` API was using `expires` instead of `expiresAt` when creating a password reset token. This has been corrected.
*   **Incorrect Field in API Route:** The `posts` API route was trying to select a non-existent `imagePrompt` field. This has been corrected to `visualPrompt`.
*   **Stripe API Key Error:** The build was failing due to a missing Stripe API key. The Stripe initialization has been made conditional to allow the build to succeed without the key, and placeholder keys have been added to the `.env` file.

## 4. Deployment

All fixes and new features have been committed and pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub. The application has been successfully built and is ready for deployment.
