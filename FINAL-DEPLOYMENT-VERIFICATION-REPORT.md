### 3. Profile Immutability Verification

**Status:** ✅ **Verified (No Changes Needed)**

**Verification Results:**

The profile immutability protection in `/app/api/profile/route.ts` has been confirmed to apply **universally to all users**, regardless of plan or role.

**Protection Mechanism:**
1. Checks for existing profile on update requests
2. Compares incoming `business_name` and `industry` with existing values
3. Returns 403 error if changes detected
4. Logs violation attempts to audit log with IP address

**Applies To:**
- ✅ Starter plan users
- ✅ Pro plan users
- ✅ Agency plan users
- ✅ All roles (CUSTOMER, AGENCY_ADMIN, etc.)

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Company name and industry are locked after initial setup to protect brand and billing integrity",
  "lockedFields": ["business_name", "industry"]
}
```

**Audit Logging:**
- Action: `ACCOUNT_PROTECTED`
- Includes: attempted field changes, IP address, timestamp
- Actor: User ID attempting the change

**Conclusion:** No changes needed. Protection is already comprehensive and plan-agnostic.
