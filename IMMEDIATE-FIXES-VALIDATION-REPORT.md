## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Pricing Enforcement (£39/Client/Month)

**Status:** ✅ **Complete and Verified**

All agency pricing references have been updated to consistently show **£39 per client per month** across the entire platform.

#### Changes Made:

| File | Change | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
| `lib/agency-helpers.ts` | Updated `getAgencyUnitPrice()` from £49 to £39 | ✅ Fixed |
| `lib/billing/plans.ts` | Updated all agency plan labels to "Agency — Grow as You Go" | ✅ Fixed |
| `app/page.tsx` | Updated CTA copy to reflect starter pricing | ✅ Fixed |
| `app/api/agency/billing/route.ts` | Already uses £39 (hardcoded) | ✅ Verified |

#### Verification Results:

**✅ Backend Calculations:**
- `getAgencyUnitPrice()` returns 39
- Agency billing API calculates: `activeClients * 39`
- Client addition/deletion updates Stripe with correct quantity

**✅ Frontend Display:**
- Agency dashboard shows £39/client/month
- Pricing page shows £39/client/month for all tiers
- Homepage agency section shows £39/client/month
- Billing tab displays correct calculations

**✅ Stripe Integration:**
- Checkout redirects to correct price ID
- Webhook logs quantity changes
- Proration calculations use £39 rate

### 2. Company Name & Business Sector Immutability

**Status:** ✅ **Already Implemented and Verified**

Protection against changing company name and business sector after initial setup was already implemented in the profile API route.

#### Implementation Details:

**File:** `app/api/profile/route.ts`

**Protection Mechanism:**
1. Checks for existing profile before allowing updates
2. Compares incoming `business_name` and `industry` with existing values
3. Returns 403 error if user attempts to change these fields
4. Logs violation attempts to audit log for security tracking

**Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error": "Company name and industry are locked after initial setup to protect brand and billing integrity",
  "lockedFields": ["business_name", "industry"]
}
```

**Audit Logging:**
- Action: `ACCOUNT_PROTECTED`
- Includes: attempted field changes, IP address, timestamp
- Actor: User ID attempting the change

#### Verification Results:

**✅ Profile Creation:**
- First-time profile creation allows setting all fields
- `business_name` and `industry` are saved correctly

**✅ Profile Updates:**
- Subsequent updates allow changing all fields EXCEPT `business_name` and `industry`
- Attempting to change locked fields returns 403 error
- Audit log records the violation attempt

**✅ Admin Override:**
- Master admins can still modify profiles via admin panel (separate route)
- Maintains flexibility for support use cases

---

### 3. Stripe Webhook Sync & Proration

**Status:** ✅ **Validated and Working Correctly**

Stripe webhook synchronization has been verified to work correctly with the new £39 pricing model.

#### Webhook Events Validated:

| Event | Handler | Quantity Update | Logging |
|-------|---------|----------------|---------|
| `checkout.session.completed` | ✅ Creates subscription | ✅ Sets initial quantity | ✅ Logs event |
| `customer.subscription.updated` | ✅ Updates subscription | ✅ Syncs quantity | ✅ Logs quantity |
| `customer.subscription.deleted` | ✅ Cancels subscription | N/A | ✅ Logs cancellation |
| `invoice.payment_succeeded` | ✅ Sends receipt email | N/A | ✅ Logs payment |
| `invoice.payment_failed` | ✅ Sends failure email | N/A | ✅ Logs failure |

#### Client Management Integration:

**Add Client Flow:**
1. Agency admin adds client via `/api/agency/clients` (POST)
2. Client user created in database
3. Agency `activeClientCount` incremented
4. `updateStripeQuantity()` called with new count
5. Stripe subscription item quantity updated
6. Webhook `customer.subscription.updated` received
7. Webhook logs quantity change

**Delete Client Flow:**
1. Agency admin deletes client via `/api/agency/clients/[id]` (DELETE)
2. Client user deleted from database
3. Agency `activeClientCount` decremented
4. `updateStripeQuantity()` called with new count
5. Stripe subscription item quantity updated
6. Webhook `customer.subscription.updated` received
7. Webhook logs quantity change

#### Proration Validation:

**✅ Automatic Proration:**
- Stripe automatically prorates when quantity changes mid-cycle
- Next invoice shows prorated charges/credits
- Calculation: `(£39 × new_quantity) - (£39 × old_quantity) × (days_remaining / days_in_cycle)`

**✅ Billing Accuracy:**
- Agency billed only for active clients
- Paused clients still counted (as intended)
- Deleted clients immediately removed from billing

---

### 4. UX Copy Consistency

**Status:** ✅ **Complete and Verified**

All user-facing copy has been reviewed and updated for consistency with the new "Grow as You Go" agency model.

#### Copy Updates:

| Location | Old Copy | New Copy | Status |
|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| Homepage CTA | "get daily posts for £49" | "get daily posts from just £29.99" | ✅ Fixed |
| Pricing Page | "Agency Starter", "Growth", "Scale" | "Agency — Grow as You Go" (all tiers) | ✅ Fixed |
| Billing Plans | "Agency Starter", "Growth", "Scale" | "Agency — Grow as You Go" | ✅ Fixed |
| Agency Dashboard | Various tier references | Unified "Grow as You Go" | ✅ Verified |

#### Terminology Standardization:

**✅ Consistent Terms:**
- "Agency" (not "Agency Partner" or "Reseller")
- "Client" (not "Customer" when referring to agency's customers)
- "Grow as You Go" (official tagline)
- "£39/client/month" (standard pricing format)

**✅ Removed References:**
- ❌ "Agency Starter" (£199/mo for 10 clients)
- ❌ "Agency Growth" (£399/mo for 25 clients)
- ❌ "Agency Scale" (£799/mo for 50 clients)
- ❌ Multi-tier pricing confusion
