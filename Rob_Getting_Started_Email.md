**Subject:** Your Social Echo Setup is Ready - Here's How to Get the Best Results

---

Hi Rob,

Your Social Echo account is fully configured and ready to generate LinkedIn content for Tower Leasing Ltd. Here's how to get the best results:

## ✅ What's Already Set Up

Your business profile is complete with:
- Industry-specific RSS feeds (Asset Finance Connect, Leasing Life, FCA Publications)
- Custom business details (leasing, funding, SME focus)
- Target audience (SME Owners, C-Suite, Financial Services)

## 🚀 How to Use Social Echo

### 1. **Generate Your First Posts**
- Go to the **Dashboard**
- Select a post type:
  - **📰 News** - Industry news commentary (uses your RSS feeds 40% of the time)
  - **💰 Selling** - Promote your leasing/funding services
  - **💡 Information & Advice** - Educational content for your audience
  - **🎲 Random/Fun** - Light-hearted business insights
- Click **"Generate New Post"**
- Review the 3 headline options and post draft

### 2. **Customize Posts (Optional)**
Use the **"Brief the AI"** box to give specific instructions:
- "Focus on our bespoke funding solutions for SMEs"
- "Write about the benefits of asset leasing vs cash purchase"
- "Highlight our 30+ years of industry experience"

### 3. **Train the AI with Feedback** ⭐ IMPORTANT
This is how Social Echo learns your preferences:

**After each generated post:**
- Click **"Good"** 👍 if you like it (AI will learn what works)
- Click **"Needs Work"** 👎 if you don't like it

**When clicking "Needs Work", add a note:**
- "Too much focus on AI/tech - I need financial services news"
- "Great tone, but make it shorter"
- "Perfect! More like this"

**Why this matters:**
- After 5-10 feedback items: AI starts adapting to your preferences
- After 20+ feedback items: AI strongly prioritizes your learned preferences
- The system extracts keywords from posts you like/dislike and adjusts accordingly

### 4. **Refine Existing Posts**
If a post is almost perfect but needs tweaks:
- Use **"Custom Instructions"** box
- Example: "Make it more casual" or "Add a mention of our 24/7 support"
- Click **"Apply & Regenerate"**

## 📊 Current Known Issue & Workaround

**Issue:** Google News is currently saturated with AI adoption stories, so News posts may show AI content even though you're in Financial Services.

**Temporary Workaround:**
1. **Give thumbs down** 👎 to AI-focused posts with notes like "not relevant to financial services"
2. After 5-10 downvotes, the AI will learn to avoid AI/tech content
3. Your RSS feeds (40% chance) will provide more targeted industry news
4. Use **"Brief the AI"** to specify: "Focus on FCA regulations" or "Write about asset finance trends"

**Alternative:** Use **Selling** or **Information & Advice** post types instead of News - these don't pull from Google News and focus purely on your services and expertise.

## 🎯 Best Practices

1. **Generate 5-10 posts this week** and provide feedback on each
2. **Mix post types** for variety (News, Selling, Advice, Random)
3. **Use "Brief the AI"** when you have a specific topic in mind
4. **Be specific with feedback** - the AI learns from your notes
5. **Check the "History"** panel to restore or review previous drafts

## 📅 Daily Workflow

1. Open Social Echo Dashboard
2. Generate 1-2 posts (try different types)
3. Review and provide feedback (Good/Needs Work)
4. Copy the best post to LinkedIn
5. Repeat tomorrow - the AI gets smarter with each feedback!
