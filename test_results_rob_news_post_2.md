## Analysis:
**PROBLEM CONFIRMED AGAIN**: Second consecutive news post about AI adoption by UK SMEs. Nearly identical to the first post:
- Same topic: AI adoption by UK SMEs
- Same statistics: 40% adoption, 20-30% productivity gains
- Same irrelevant focus on AI/tech transformation

**Pattern**: The news service is consistently pulling the SAME type of irrelevant AI/tech news stories.

**Root Cause Hypothesis**:
1. Google News queries are too generic ("Financial Services UK" or "UK SMEs")
2. Negative keyword filtering (-5 penalty) is insufficient to overcome relevance scores
3. AI/SME adoption stories dominate UK business news and rank highly
4. Industry-specific queries not specific enough (need "FCA regulations", "asset finance", "leasing industry")

**Severity**: CRITICAL - 100% failure rate on news posts for Financial Services user
