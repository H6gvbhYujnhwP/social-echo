# Trial Access Control System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive trial access control system implemented for SocialEcho. The system enforces trial duration, automatic suspension of expired trials, and usage limits across all protected endpoints.

## Changes Made

### 1. Centralized Access Control Helper (`lib/access-control.ts`)

Created a new centralized access control module that provides:

**Key Functions:**

- `checkUserAccess(userId)` - Validates subscription status, auto-suspends expired trials, blocks suspended accounts
- `checkPostGenerationAccess(userId)` - Checks both access and usage limits for post generation
- `incrementUsageCount(userId)` - Increments usage counter after successful generation
- `getUserSubscriptionStatus(userId)` - Returns subscription status for display purposes

**Features:**

- ✅ Automatic trial expiration detection and suspension
- ✅ Blocks suspended and canceled accounts
- ✅ Validates subscription status (active, trial, trialing, past_due)
- ✅ Returns detailed error messages for better UX
- ✅ Provides subscription data for further checks

**Supported Subscription Statuses:**

- `trial` - Admin-created trial users (with trialEnd date)
- `trialing` - Stripe-managed trial users
- `active` - Active paid subscriptions
- `past_due` - Grace period for failed payments
- `suspended` - Auto-suspended expired trials or admin-suspended accounts
- `canceled` - Canceled subscriptions

### 2. Admin Trial User Creation Fix (`app/admin/users/actions.ts`)

**Before:**
```typescript
status: 'active',  // Wrong - didn't respect trial duration
// trialEnd was not set
```

**After:**
```typescript
status: 'trial',  // Correct - marks as trial user
trialEnd: periodEnd,  // Sets expiration date based on trial duration
```

**Impact:**
- Trial users created by admin now have proper `trial` status
- `trialEnd` field is populated with calculated expiration date
- Trial duration (minutes/hours/days) is properly converted and applied
- Expired trials will be automatically suspended on next access attempt

### 3. Protected Endpoints Updated

All critical endpoints now use centralized access control:

#### **Generate Text API** (`app/api/generate-text/route.ts`)
- ✅ Replaced manual subscription checks with `checkUserAccess()`
- ✅ Enforces trial expiration and suspension
- ✅ Simplified usage limit checking using subscription data from access check
- ✅ Returns consistent error messages

#### **Generate Image API** (`app/api/generate-image/route.ts`)
- ✅ Added authentication check (was missing!)
- ✅ Added access control check (was completely missing!)
- ✅ Now blocks expired trials and suspended accounts
- ✅ Consistent with generate-text endpoint

#### **Planner API** (`app/api/planner/route.ts`)
- ✅ Added access control to prevent trial users from bypassing limits
- ✅ Blocks expired trials from updating planner schedule

#### **History API** (`app/api/history/route.ts`)
- ✅ Added access control to both GET and POST methods
- ✅ Prevents expired trials from viewing or saving history

## How It Works

### Trial Creation Flow

1. Admin creates trial user via admin panel
2. System calculates `trialEnd` date based on duration (e.g., 7 days, 14 days, 30 days)
3. Subscription created with:
   - `status: 'trial'`
   - `trialEnd: <calculated date>`
   - `usageLimit: <based on plan>`
   - `usageCount: 0`

### Access Control Flow

1. User attempts to access protected feature (generate post, image, etc.)
2. Endpoint calls `checkUserAccess(userId)`
3. Access control helper:
   - Checks if subscription exists
   - If status is `trial` and `trialEnd` has passed:
     - Auto-updates status to `suspended`
     - Returns access denied with expiration message
   - If status is `suspended` or `canceled`:
     - Returns access denied
   - If status is valid (`active`, `trial`, `trialing`, `past_due`):
     - Returns access granted with subscription data
4. Endpoint proceeds or returns error based on result

### Trial Expiration Flow

1. Trial user's `trialEnd` date passes
2. On next access attempt:
   - `checkUserAccess()` detects expiration
   - Automatically updates `status` from `trial` to `suspended`
   - Returns error message: "Your trial has expired. Please subscribe to continue using SocialEcho."
3. User is blocked from all protected features
4. User must subscribe to reactivate account

## Testing Checklist

### Admin Trial Creation
- [ ] Create trial user with 1 minute duration
- [ ] Verify subscription has `status: 'trial'`
- [ ] Verify `trialEnd` is set to ~1 minute from now
- [ ] Verify `usageLimit` matches selected plan

### Trial Access During Valid Period
- [ ] Login as trial user
- [ ] Generate text post (should work)
- [ ] Generate image (should work)
- [ ] Update planner (should work)
- [ ] View history (should work)
- [ ] Verify usage count increments

### Trial Expiration
- [ ] Wait for trial to expire (or manually update `trialEnd` in database)
- [ ] Attempt to generate post
- [ ] Verify error: "Your trial has expired"
- [ ] Verify status auto-updated to `suspended`
- [ ] Verify all endpoints blocked

### Usage Limits
- [ ] Create trial with low usage limit (e.g., 2 posts)
- [ ] Generate posts until limit reached
- [ ] Verify error: "You've used all X posts for this period"
- [ ] Verify cannot generate more posts

### Suspended Account
- [ ] Admin suspends user account
- [ ] User attempts to access features
- [ ] Verify all endpoints return access denied
- [ ] Verify error message indicates suspension

## Database Schema

### Subscription Model Fields

```prisma
model Subscription {
  id         String   @id @default(cuid())
  userId     String   @unique
  
  plan       String   @default("starter")  // "starter" | "pro"
  status     String   @default("active")   // "active" | "trial" | "trialing" | "suspended" | "canceled" | "past_due"
  
  usageCount Int      @default(0)
  usageLimit Int      @default(8)
  
  currentPeriodStart DateTime @default(now())
  currentPeriodEnd   DateTime
  
  trialEnd   DateTime?  // Set for admin-created trials
  
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Error Messages

The system provides clear, user-friendly error messages:

| Scenario | Error Message |
|----------|---------------|
| No subscription | "Subscription required. Please subscribe to a plan." |
| Trial expired | "Your trial has expired. Please subscribe to continue using SocialEcho." |
| Account suspended | "Your account has been suspended. Please contact support or update your subscription." |
| Account canceled | "Your subscription has been canceled. Please reactivate to continue." |
| Usage limit reached | "You've used all X posts for this period. Upgrade your plan for more posts." |
| Invalid status | "Subscription status 'X' is not valid. Please contact support." |

## Security Considerations

1. **Automatic Enforcement**: Trial expiration is checked on every request, not just periodically
2. **Database-Level Updates**: Status changes are persisted immediately to prevent race conditions
3. **Centralized Logic**: Single source of truth for access control prevents inconsistencies
4. **Fail-Safe**: If subscription is missing or invalid, access is denied by default
5. **No Client-Side Bypass**: All checks happen server-side in API routes

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

1. **Grace Period**: Add configurable grace period after trial expiration
2. **Email Notifications**: Send email warnings before trial expires
3. **Usage Warnings**: Notify users when approaching usage limits
4. **Trial Extensions**: Allow admin to extend trials without creating new accounts
5. **Scheduled Cleanup**: Background job to suspend expired trials (currently done on-demand)
6. **Analytics**: Track trial conversion rates and usage patterns
