# Social Echo: Comprehensive Resend Email Notification System

**Author:** Manus AI
**Date:** October 04, 2025

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a detailed summary of the comprehensive email notification system implemented for the Social Echo application using the Resend API. This system ensures that users receive timely and professional communications for all critical account and billing events. The implementation is complete, tested, and has been pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub.

## 2. Email Service Infrastructure

A robust and centralized email service has been established to handle all outgoing communications. This infrastructure is designed to be easily maintainable and extensible.

### 2.1. Resend Client Configuration

A new file, `lib/email/resend.ts`, has been created to initialize and configure the Resend client. The client is only initialized if the `RESEND_API_KEY` is present in the environment variables, allowing the application to build and run successfully even without the key being set.

### 2.2. Email Service Helpers

The file `lib/email/service.ts` contains helper functions that abstract the email sending logic. This includes a generic `sendEmail` function and specific functions for each type of notification (e.g., `sendWelcomeEmail`, `sendPasswordResetEmail`). This approach centralizes the email sending process and makes it easy to trigger notifications from anywhere in the application.

## 3. Email Templates

A suite of professional HTML email templates has been created in `lib/email/templates.ts`. Each template includes a fallback text version for email clients that do not support HTML. The templates are designed to be visually appealing and consistent with the Social Echo brand.

The following email templates have been created:

| Template                      | Description                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Welcome Email**             | Sent to new users upon successful account creation.                         |
| **Password Reset Email**      | Sent when a user requests to reset their password.                          |
| **2FA Enabled Email**         | Confirms that two-factor authentication has been enabled on the account.    |
| **Payment Success Email**     | Confirms a successful subscription payment.                                 |
| **Payment Failed Email**      | Notifies the user of a failed payment and prompts them to update their payment method. |
| **Subscription Upgraded Email** | Confirms a successful plan upgrade.                                         |
| **Subscription Cancelled Email**| Confirms that a subscription has been cancelled and provides the end date of the service. |
| **Usage Limit Warning Email** | Sent when a user reaches 80% of their monthly post generation limit.        |
| **Account Suspended Email**   | Notifies a user that their account has been suspended by an administrator.  |
| **Account Reactivated Email** | Confirms that a suspended account has been reactivated.                     |

## 4. Integration with API Routes

The email notification system has been integrated into all relevant API routes to ensure that emails are sent automatically at the appropriate times.

### 4.1. Account Management

*   **Signup (`/api/auth/signup`):** Sends a welcome email to new users.
*   **Password Reset (`/api/auth/request-reset`):** Sends a password reset email with a secure link.
*   **2FA Setup (`/api/auth/2fa/setup`):** Sends a confirmation email when 2FA is enabled.

### 4.2. Administrative Actions

*   **Suspend User (`/api/admin/users/[id]/suspend`):** Sends an account suspension notification.
*   **Unsuspend User (`/api/admin/users/[id]/unsuspend`):** Sends an account reactivation notification.

### 4.3. Billing and Subscriptions (Stripe Webhooks)

The Stripe webhook handler at `/api/webhooks/stripe` has been updated to send the following emails:

*   `checkout.session.completed`: Sends a payment success email.
*   `customer.subscription.updated`: Sends a subscription upgrade email if the plan has changed.
*   `customer.subscription.deleted`: Sends a subscription cancellation email.
*   `invoice.payment_failed`: Sends a payment failed notification.

### 4.4. Usage Limits

*   **Generate Text (`/api/generate-text`):** After a user generates a post, the system checks their usage. If their usage is at 80% or more of their limit, a warning email is sent.

## 5. Deployment

All changes related to the Resend email notification system have been successfully built, committed, and pushed to the `main` branch on GitHub. The application is now ready for deployment with the new email system fully integrated.
