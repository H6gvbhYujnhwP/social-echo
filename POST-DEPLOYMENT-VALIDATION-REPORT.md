---

## 🚨 Known Considerations

### 1. Cache Invalidation

After deployment, verify that static pages are serving the new content and not cached versions.

**Actions:**
- Monitor first page load after deployment
- Check for any cached old pricing
- Trigger manual cache clear if needed

### 2. Existing Subscriptions

**Status:** ✅ **Handled**

Existing agency subscriptions with old plan keys (`SocialEcho_AgencyStarter`, etc.) will continue to work correctly. The plan labels have been updated to "Agency — Grow as You Go" but the underlying Stripe price IDs remain the same.

**No Action Required:** Backward compatibility maintained.

### 3. Stripe Webhook Events

**Status:** ✅ **Enhanced**

Webhook logging has been significantly enhanced. Monitor the logs after deployment to ensure all events are being captured correctly.

- Verify quantity updates are logged
- Confirm email notifications sent
