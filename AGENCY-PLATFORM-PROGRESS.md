## 📝 Code Quality & Best Practices

### What's Been Implemented Well

✅ **TypeScript Types** - All functions have proper types  
✅ **Error Handling** - Try-catch blocks in all API routes  
✅ **Audit Logging** - All sensitive actions logged  
✅ **RBAC** - Role-based access control enforced  
✅ **Email Templates** - Professional HTML + text versions  
✅ **Database Indexes** - Optimized queries with indexes  
✅ **API Response Consistency** - Standard JSON responses  

### Areas for Improvement (Optional)

🔸 **Session Management** - Impersonation uses basic session; consider JWT tokens  
🔸 **Rate Limiting** - Add rate limiting to API endpoints  
🔸 **Caching** - Cache agency branding lookups  
🔸 **Monitoring** - Add Sentry or LogRocket for error tracking  
🔸 **Analytics** - Track agency usage metrics  

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option 1: Continue Implementation (Recommended)

Proceed with Phases 3-7 systematically:
1. Phase 3: Pricing & Checkout (3-4 hours)
2. Phase 4: Onboarding Wizard (4-5 hours)
3. Phase 5: Stripe Webhooks (5-6 hours)
4. Phase 6: UI Copy Updates (4-5 hours)
5. Phase 7: Comprehensive Testing (6-8 hours)

**Total Time:** ~22-31 hours

### Option 2: MVP Launch (Faster)

Launch with current features and add remaining features post-launch:

**Launch Now:**
- Core infrastructure ✅
- Branded login ✅
- Impersonation ✅
- Agency dashboard ✅
- Client management ✅

**Add Later:**
- Onboarding wizard
- Quantity-based billing automation
- Advanced webhooks

**Time to Launch:** ~2-4 hours (testing + deployment)

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach

Launch MVP with manual agency setup, automate later:
- Admin manually creates agencies in database
- Agencies can add clients via dashboard
- Stripe billing managed manually initially
- Automate webhooks and onboarding in Phase 2
