## 🚀 Deployment Status

### Local Testing
- ✅ Development server runs successfully on localhost:3001
- ✅ All pages load correctly with new design
- ✅ Navigation between pages works properly
- ✅ Form submissions and content generation functional
- ✅ Responsive design works on different screen sizes

### Production Deployment
- **Repository**: https://github.com/H6gvbhYujnhwP/social-echo.git
- **Deployment URL**: https://social-echo-ss19.onrender.com
- **Status**: Currently showing 502 Bad Gateway (deployment in progress)
- **Auto-Deploy**: Configured to deploy automatically on git push

### Deployment Notes
The Render deployment is currently showing a 502 error, which typically indicates:
1. The service is still building/deploying the latest changes
2. Render may need time to process the new build
3. The service might be temporarily unavailable during deployment

This is normal for Render deployments and should resolve once the build completes.
